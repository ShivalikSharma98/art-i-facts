Art(i)facts is a react application based on the Harvard Art Museum Rest Style API. The application allows visitors to use a keyword search parameter to look through the art museum database and returns the most relevant pieces in the form of cards. Visitors are then able to look through the cards and click the details button if they wish to learn more about a specific piece.

Technologies:

This project was built using the Javascript library React, React-Bootstrap for styling, and data from the Harvard Art Museum API.

Getting started:

To install the code for this application, please fork this repository, copy the ssh url in the forked repo, in the command line run git clone <url>, and create a new branch using git checkout -b <branch>, install all dependencies using npm i, run the code using npm run start, and open with (code .).

Contribution guidelines:

Majority of the bugs within this application are in the results component, which renders the cards for all the specific peieces returned by a search, and the info componenet which renders a page containing more information on the specific piece that was clicked on.
